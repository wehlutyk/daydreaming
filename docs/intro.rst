About

Day Dreaming is a pilot cognitive science experiment using smartphones. It takes advantage of *in vivo* possibilities, that is measurements that are not usually possible in a lab.

The aim of the experiment is to explore some aspects of what is called **mind wandering**. Mind wandering is when we start thinking of things that aren't directly related to our environment. Thinking in the future, in the past, thinking of people who aren't there, are all simple examples of mind wandering. It turns out we human beings mind-wander a significant portion of our time.

The technical side of the experiment consists of two parts:

* An Android application, `daydreaming <https://github.com/wehlutyk/daydreaming>`_; these pages document its behaviour.
* A general-purpose server, `yelandur <https://github.com/wehlutyk/yelandur>`_; it receives data sent to it by the app from Android devices.
