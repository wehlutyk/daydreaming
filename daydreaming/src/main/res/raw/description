This application is part of a research project that seeks to better understand the experience of daydreaming.

Our goal is twofold: describe the richness of human mental life and understand the conditions causing people to daydream.

The Daydreaming app is very easy to use. Several times a day, the app will ask you to answer a few questions about your current surroundings, activities and thoughts. You will also fill some questionnaires at the very beginning, and a couple of question every morning and every evening.

That’s it! After a few weeks of using the app, you will unlock a “See Results” sections summarizing your responses. You’ll get to discover what kind of daydreamer you are!

Before starting, you will be asked to answer a few questions about yourself. This should only take a few minutes, and only needs to be done once.
