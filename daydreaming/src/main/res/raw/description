This application is part of a research project that seeks to better understand the experience of daydreaming.

Our goal is to better understand what conditions cause people to daydream, how daydreaming people’s impacts day-to-day life, and how we can all learn to control our daydreaming tendencies so as to maximize our health and well-being.

The Daydreaming app is very easy to use. Several times a day, the app will ask you to answer a few brief questions about your current activities, thoughts, and/or feelings.

That’s it! After a few weeks of using the app, you will unlock a “My Daydreams” sections that  shows you some information about your responses and describes the type of mind-wanderer you are.

Before starting, you will be asked to answer a few questions about yourself and to define the settings of the app. This should only take a few minutes, and only needs to be done once.
