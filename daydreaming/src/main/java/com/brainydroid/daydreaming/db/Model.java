/**
 * Abstract base class for objects that are stored in an SQLite database.
 * <p/>
 * This model implements an {@link #id} for the model. If the {@link #id} is
 * not set (equals {@code -1}), it means the model instance is not saved to
 * the database. If the {@link #id} is different from {@code -1},
 * it means the model is persisted to database, and any change on the model's
 * values should be saved.
 * <p/>
 * The parameterization of the class is a bit intricate,
 * but that is to provide a way of calling {@link Model#save} directly on
 * the model (instead of having to call {@link ModelStorage#store}@{code
 * (model)}). See
 * <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16689810/casting-a-generic-superclass-to-a-subclass">
 * my StackOverflow question</a> about that for more details.
