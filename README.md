Day Dreaming is a pilot cognitive science experiment using smartphones. It takes advantage of *in vivo* possibilities, that is measurements that are not usually possible in a lab.

The aim of the experiment is to explore some aspects of what is called **mind wandering**. Mind wandering is when we start thinking of things that aren't directly related to our environment. Thinking in the future, in the past, thinking of people who aren't there, are all simple examples of mind wandering. It turns out we human beings mind-wander a significant portion of our time.

This Android app works with [Yelandur](https://github.com/wehlutyk/yelandur) as backend server to collect data for the experiment.

More information can be found on the project's website: TBD
