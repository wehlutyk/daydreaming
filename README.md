Daydreaming is a pilot cognitive science experiment using smartphones. It
takes advantage of *in vivo* possibilities, that is measurements that are
not usually possible in a lab.

The aim of the experiment is to explore some aspects of what is called
**mind wandering**. Mind wandering is when we start thinking of things that
 aren't directly related to our environment. Thinking in the future,
 in the past, thinking of people who aren't there, are all simple examples
 of mind wandering. It turns out we human beings mind-wander a significant
 portion of our time.

This Android app works with [Yelandur](https://github.com/wehlutyk/yelandur)
as backend server to collect data for the experiment.
